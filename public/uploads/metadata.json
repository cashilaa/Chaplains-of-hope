    "description": "The Dagoretti Capacity Building Workshop for Men was successfully held at the Dagoretti South Empowerment Center, addressing critical topics such as gender-based violence (GBV), masculinity, and cultural influences. The discussions aimed to shift mindsets and promote positive male engagement in addressing GBV-related issues.\r\n\r\nKey Takeaways:\r\n\r\n✔ Redefining Masculinity – Encouraging men to embrace positive masculinity that fosters equality and respect.\r\n✔ Challenging Harmful Cultural Norms – Addressing traditional beliefs that perpetuate GBV and advocating for progressive change.\r\n✔ Men as Allies in Ending GBV – Emphasizing the role of men in prevention, accountability, and advocacy.\r\n✔ Support Systems & Mental Health – Highlighting the importance of psychosocial support for men to break cycles of violence.\r\n\r\nWe extend our sincere appreciation to our partners—Kenya Human Rights Commission,UNDP Kenya, and the Social Justice Centers Working Group—for making this impactful conversation possible.\r\n\r\n#UNDPKenya\r\n#ChaplainsOfHopeSocialJusticeCenter\r\n#KenyaHumanRightsCommission\r\n#SocialJusticeCentersWorkingGroup",
